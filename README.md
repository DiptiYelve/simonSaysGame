# Simon Says Game

## Description
The Simon Says game is a memory-based game where the player must repeat a sequence of flashing lights or sounds. The game progressively increases the difficulty by adding one more step to the sequence after each round.

This project is implemented using **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, with no external libraries.
